## Bioreactor Design 101 (Part 1)
Objective: This blog post summarizes the concept of a bioreactor and includes basic descriptions of several major types of bioreactors
### What is a bioreactor?
A bioreactor is an apparatus for promoting the growth and activity of organisms or biochemically active substances. Most commonly, bioreactors are used to scale up bacterial production of some desired substance. Bioreactors are classified based on how they control the physical and biochemical conditions of the reaction. Two common schemes for bioreactors are Batch and Continuous[1]
### Batch Reactors
Batch bioreactors operate "like giant washing machines" [2] All of the necessary components for the reaction are added to a chamber, and it is sealed. As a result, the user cannot control any parameters aside from temperature a the reaction proceeds. This type of reactor is useful for industrial operations where the process is well characterized. However, in a research or other setting where the conditions of the reactor need to be monitored or modulated over time, batch reactors are less useful.
### Continuous
A continuous bioreactor operates with fluid flowing into and out of the reactor at all times. The inflow speed and composition of the fluid can be controlled based on feedback from sensors that communicate the state of the culture. Several factors including optical density and the concentration of different substance can be used to drive the control of a continuous bioreactor. Continuous bioreactors offer the added benefit of making live-time alterations to the culture environment.[3] If a process is still being optimized, the user can tweak the settings without having to completely start over as they would with a batch bioreactor.
